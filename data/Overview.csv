AI-driven Car Damage Identification,VehiDE dataset,"13,945 high-resolution images annotated across 8 damage categories","YOLOv5, Mask R-CNN, SGL-KRN, PoolNet, U2-Net, CSNet, DCN","Real-time object detection (YOLOv5), precise segmentation (Mask R-CNN), handling irregular damages and salient object detection (SGL-KRN, PoolNet, U2-Net, CSNet, DCN)","SGL-KRN: Best performance, PoolNet: Strong, U2-Net: Decent, CSNet and DCN: Less accurate"
Procedural Generation for Damage Assessment in Vehicles,CrashCar101 dataset,"101,050 synthetic images with pixel-accurate annotations for vehicle parts and damage types","DeepLabv3 (ResNet-50, ResNet-101), SegFormer (B5 variant)",Semantic segmentation for part and damage identification; few-shot learning for real-world transferability,DeepLabv3 (ResNet-101): Significant improvement in few-shot learning (up to +17.9% mIoU); SegFormer: Consistent outperformance over models trained on real data
Vision-based Car Damage Detection,CarDD dataset,"4,000 high-resolution images with over 9,000 annotated instances across 6 damage categories (dent, scratch, crack, glass shatter, tire flat, lamp broken)","Mask R-CNN, Cascade Mask R-CNN, GCNet, HTC, DCN, DCN+, SGL-KRN, PoolNet, U2-Net, CSNet","Instance segmentation and object detection (Mask R-CNN, Cascade Mask R-CNN, GCNet, HTC, DCN), enhanced performance on difficult damage types with DCN+, refinement of irregular damage detection with Salient Object Detection (SGL-KRN, PoolNet, U2-Net, CSNet)","DCN+: Best performance on difficult classes (dent, scratch, crack); SGL-KRN: Best overall SOD performance with emphasis on small and slender objects"
