AI-driven Car Damage Identification,VehiDE dataset,"13,945 high-resolution images annotated across 8 damage categories","YOLOv5, Mask R-CNN, SGL-KRN, PoolNet, U2-Net, CSNet, DCN","Real-time object detection (YOLOv5), precise segmentation (Mask R-CNN), handling irregular damages and salient object detection (SGL-KRN, PoolNet, U2-Net, CSNet, DCN)","SGL-KRN: Best performance, PoolNet: Strong, U2-Net: Decent, CSNet and DCN: Less accurate"
Procedural Generation for Damage Assessment in Vehicles,CrashCar101 dataset,"101,050 synthetic images with pixel-accurate annotations for vehicle parts and damage types","DeepLabv3 (ResNet-50, ResNet-101), SegFormer (B5 variant)",Semantic segmentation for part and damage identification; few-shot learning for real-world transferability,DeepLabv3 (ResNet-101): Significant improvement in few-shot learning (up to +17.9% mIoU); SegFormer: Consistent outperformance over models trained on real data
Vision-based Car Damage Detection,CarDD dataset,"4,000 high-resolution images with over 9,000 annotated instances across 6 damage categories (dent, scratch, crack, glass shatter, tire flat, lamp broken)","Mask R-CNN, Cascade Mask R-CNN, GCNet, HTC, DCN, DCN+, SGL-KRN, PoolNet, U2-Net, CSNet","Instance segmentation and object detection (Mask R-CNN, Cascade Mask R-CNN, GCNet, HTC, DCN), enhanced performance on difficult damage types with DCN+, refinement of irregular damage detection with Salient Object Detection (SGL-KRN, PoolNet, U2-Net, CSNet)","DCN+: Best performance on difficult classes (dent, scratch, crack); SGL-KRN: Best overall SOD performance with emphasis on small and slender objects"
Vehicle Damage Severity Estimation for Insurance Operations,"Combination of public and private datasets including 18,000 claims with 200,000 images for training and 2,600 claims with 30,000 images for validation","Annotated vehicle parts, damage types (broken light, broken window, dent, missing part), interior/exterior classification, vehicle angle classification","YOLOv4, VGG-16, ResNet-18, Mask R-CNN with Deformable Convolutions (MaskR-DCN), ResNet-34, XGBoost","Vehicle detection (YOLOv4), interior/exterior classification (VGG-16), angle classification (ResNet-18), damage and parts segmentation (MaskR-DCN), airbag deployment detection (ResNet-34), final damage severity prediction (XGBoost)",YOLOv4 with high-resolution input and test-time augmentation provided the best vehicle detection performance; MaskR-DCN outperformed Mask R-CNN in parts and damage detection; XGBoost combining structured and image features improved severity prediction by over 2% AUC compared to using structured data alone
Deep Learning-Based Car Damage Classification and Cost Estimation,"Custom dataset created from images collected from the Copart website, supplemented with the COCO dataset for additional validation","Manually annotated images with bounding boxes and masks for various damage types (bumper dents, door dents, broken headlights, scratches, etc.), separated into training and testing sets",Two Mask R-CNN models,"First Mask R-CNN for detecting vehicle sides (front, back, left, right) to influence cost estimation; Second Mask R-CNN for detecting and segmenting specific damage areas for accurate classification and cost estimation",98.5% accuracy in damage detection and classification; high confidence in mask generation with a performance accuracy of over 0.97
